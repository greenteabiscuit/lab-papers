abstract = {With the emergence of accelerator devices such as multicores, graphics-processing units (GPUs), and field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), application designers are confronted with the problem of searching a huge design space that has been shown to have widely varying performance and energy metrics for different accelerators, different application domains, and different use cases. To address this problem, numerous studies have evaluated specific applications across different accelerators. In this paper, we analyze an important domain of applications, referred to as sliding-window applications, when executing on FPGAs, GPUs, and multicores. For each device, we present optimization strategies and analyze use cases where each device is most effective. The results show that FPGAs can achieve speedup of up to 11x and 57x compared to GPUs and multicores, respectively, while also using orders of magnitude less energy.},

	abstract = {Respiratory droplets are the primary transmission route for SARS-CoV-2. Evidence suggests that virus transmission can be reduced by face coverings, but robust evidence for how mask usage might affect safe distancing parameters is lacking. Accordingly, we investigate the effectiveness of surgical masks and single-layer cotton masks on mitigating dispersion of large respiratory droplets (i.e. non aerosol). We tested a manikin ejecting fluorescent droplets and human volunteers in speaking and coughing conditions. We quantified the number of droplets in flight using laser sheet illumination and UV-light for those that had landed at table height at up to 2m. For human volunteers, expiratory droplets were caught on a microscope slide 5cm from the mouth. Whether manikin or human, wearing a face covering decreased the number of projected droplets by \&gt;1000-fold. We estimated that a person standing 2m from someone coughing without a mask is exposed to over 1000 times more respiratory droplets than from someone standing 5 cm away wearing a basic single layer mask. Our results indicate that face coverings show consistent efficacy at blocking respiratory droplets. If aerosol transmission is later determined to be a significant driver of infection, then our findings may overestimate the effectiveness of face coverings.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementBandiera is supported by the UK Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC), grant no.
